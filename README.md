Riot.js official webpack loader

## Important

If you are using Riot.js < 4.0.0 please check the [v3 branch](https://github.com/riot/webpack-loader/tree/v3)

## Installation

```shell
npm i @riotjs/webpack-loader @riotjs/compiler -D
```

## Usage

Add the `@riotjs/webpack-loader` in your `webpack.config.js` file
```js
module.exports = {
  module: {
    rules: [
      {
        test: /\.riot$/,
        exclude: /node_modules/,
        use: [{
          loader: '@riotjs/webpack-loader',
          options: {
            hot: false, // set it to true if you are using hmr
            // add here all the other @riotjs/compiler options riot.js.org/compiler
            // template: 'pug' for example
          }
        }]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

If you want to enable hmr via `hot` option you will need to install also [`@riotjs/hot-reload`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@riotjs/hot-reload)

```shell
npm i @riotjs/hot-reload -D
```

And afterwards webpack will be able to automatically reload your Riot.js components in runtime.
